I built a demo interface where user can interact with the computer by telling its name, amount to deposit, amount to withdraw, and to as well as check its available amount.
I built this code with html, css and JavaScript
I encountered some problems in modifying figures from the JavaScript file, but I was able to get through.
This is only but a walk-in-progress into my JavaScript journey. In a matter of time, I'll perfect my skills in it.
